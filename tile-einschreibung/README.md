Displayed as a separate tile on the home screen, the redirect leads to a separate tablet page with explanations about registration at the library. Pepper actively asks whether it should take the user to the corresponding point of interest in the integrated map of the library's main hall. If the answer is positive, Pepper drives off independently and returns to the home screen after arriving at the POI.
