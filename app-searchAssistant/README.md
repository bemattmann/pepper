# searchAssistant
Repository for all developments in the separate app, which makes it possible to search for media in the library catalogue [swisscovery RZS](https://rzs.swisscovery.org), collect them on favourites lists and take them with you via QR code.

The app starts in [tile-selectPage](/../main/app-searchAssistant/tile-selectPage) and opens the possibility to choose the search methodology. Then either a free-text search for title, author or subject (see [tile-normalSearch](/../main/app-searchAssistant/tile-normalSearch)) or an advanced search (see [tile-customSearch](/../main/app-searchAssistant/tile-customSearch)) is started via voice input. The results found are processed (see [tile-resultOverview](/../main/app-searchAssistant/tile-resultOverview)) and can be collected on a watch list (see [tile-favoritesOverview](/../main/app-searchAssistant/tile-favoritesOverview)). Finally, the watch list can be taken along via QR code (see [tile-favoritesShare](/../main/app-searchAssistant/tile-favoritesShare)).
