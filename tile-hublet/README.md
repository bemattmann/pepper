# Documentation
Displayed as an independent tile on the [service subdirectory](/../main/subdir-service), the redirection leads to a separate tablet page with explanations about the services offered by the Hublets, lendable tablets with integrated e-media services of the library. Pepper actively asks whether it should take the user to the corresponding point of interest in the integrated map of the library's main hall. If the answer is positive, Pepper drives off independently and returns to the home screen after arriving at the POI.
